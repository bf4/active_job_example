## Workers

# ActiveJobExample::Worker.perform_later record  # Enqueue a job to be performed as soon the queueing system is free.
# MyJob.set(wait_until: Date.tomorrow.noon).perform_later(record)  # Enqueue a job to be performed tomorrow at noon.
# MyJob.set(wait: 1.week).perform_later(record) # Enqueue a job to be performed 1 week from now.
